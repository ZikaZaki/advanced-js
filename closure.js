// // Lexical Scope defines how variable names are resolved in nested functions.
// // Nested (child) functions have access to the scope of their parent functions.
// // This is often confused with closure, but lexical scope is only an important part of closure.

// // w3schools: "A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed (returned)."

// // A closure is created when we define a function, not when a function is executed.

// // global scope
// let x = 1;
