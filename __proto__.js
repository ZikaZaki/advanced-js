// Prototypal Inheritance and the Prototype Chain.

// ES6 introduced classes which is the modern way to construct objects.

// That said, prototypal inheritance and the prototype chain are:
// 1) "under the hood", (ES6 Classes are considered "syntactic sugar")
// 2) often in interview questions.
// 3) and are useful to understand.

// Object literals
const person = {
  alive: true
}

const musician = {
  plays: true
}
